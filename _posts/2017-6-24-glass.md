> It's easy to claim perfection.

It's easy to claim perfection.<br>
To pretend all is perfect.<br>
We ask how we are,<br>
Yet we lie to each other.<br>

<!--more-->

The secret isn't very inclusive.<br>
The world is anything but put-together.<br>
Inside our homes there is a pressure leaking.<br>
Always threatening to escape.<br>

We find comfort in our denial.<br>
We truly believe it ourselves.<br>
On the outside we glow a fake suntan orange.<br>
The chemicals reflecting our state of mind.<br>

There is no shame in the dirt on our flesh.<br>
The stress that drains from our eyes,<br>
Or the blood on our tongues.<br>
There is little to apologize for.<br>

The best advice is to ignore the guilt.<br>
We are but fragile glass on the shelf.<br>
Sitting among our neighbors.<br>
Pretending we do not hear.<br>

For whatever it's worth the journey has a purpose.<br>
There is always an end to the trail.<br>
We can continue to disguise our sorrow.<br>
Or we can embrace each other in the rain.<br>
