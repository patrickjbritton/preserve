> It's easy to claim perfection.

***It's easy to claim perfection.
<br>To pretend all is perfect.
<br>We ask how we are,
<br>Yet we lie to each other.***

*<!--more-->*

***The secret isn't very inclusive.
<br>The world is anything but put-together.
<br>Inside our homes there is a pressure leaking.
<br>Always threatening to escape.***

***We find comfort in our denial.
<br>We truly believe it ourselves.
<br>On the outside we glow a fake suntan orange.
<br>The chemicals reflecting our state of mind.***

***There is no shame in the dirt on our flesh.
<br>The stress that drains from our eyes,
<br>Or the blood on our tongues.
<br>There is little to apologize for.***

***The best advice is to ignore the guilt.
<br>We are but fragile glass on the shelf.
<br>Sitting among our neighbors.
<br>Pretending we do not hear.***

***Or we can embrace each other in the rain.
<br>We can continue to disguise our sorrow.
<br>There is always an end to the trail.
<br>For whatever it's worth the journey has a purpose.***
