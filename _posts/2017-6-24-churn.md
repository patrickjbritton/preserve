> Watching from below, sinking undertow.

The tower in the sky.<br>
The wicked watching from high rising,<br>
the kings scoffing snidely.<br>
Watching from below, sinking undertow.<br>
Furthest from the crushing tides.<br>
Closest to the golden sky.<br>

<!--more-->


Far from the dirty and meek.<br>
Finding glory in crushing the weak.<br>
The ones with the crown,<br>
always controlling the crowd.<br>

Keep yourselves together,<br>
Prepare for the bad weather.<br>
We no longer rise to defend,<br>
We only rise to pay the rent.<br>

We drag the stones,<br>
Ache in our bones,<br>
As they drink from silver on thrones.<br>
We find little shelter from the drones.<br>

We are but the flea,<br>
flung from the knee.<br>
We are but the wretched,<br>
Churning among the wicked.
